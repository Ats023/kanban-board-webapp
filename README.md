# Kanban-Board Productivity Tool

### Description:
The Kanban-Board project applies agile project management principles featuring task cards, status columns, and a Fibonacci point system. Users can perform CRUD operations on task cards, and use the drag-and-drop functionality for effortlessly shifting tasks between columns. It mocks a REST API using json-server for fetching and updating data,  thereby producing real-time changes on the tasks.

### Features:
1. Task Creation: Every column is associated with an 'add' button which assists the user in creating tasks for that specific column.
2. Change Task title/points: Clicking on the task title immediately allows the user to edit it. For changing task points, use the '+' and '-' buttons associated with task points.
3. Drag-and-Drop: All task cards are draggable and can be dragged to any other status column. The app automatically updates the status of the task.
4. Delete Task: Click on the 'trash' icon to delete the task altogether.
